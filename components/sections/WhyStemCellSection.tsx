          Stem cell therapy is gaining attention as a potential therapeutic approach for autism. While research is ongoing, there are several theoretical mechanisms by which stem cells might help:

              <span><strong>Reduce inflammation:</strong> Stem cells release anti-inflammatory factors that can reduce neuroinflammation associated with autism.</span>

              <span className="bg-teal-100 text-teal-800 rounded-full w-6 h-6 flex items-center justify-center mr-3 flex-shrink-0">2</span>
              <span><strong>Enhance neural connectivity:</strong> They may support the formation of new neural connections in areas affected by autism.</span>

              <span><strong>Support immune regulation:</strong> Stem cells can modulate immune function, which may be dysregulated in some individuals with autism.</span>

              <span><strong>Promote tissue repair:</strong> They can aid in repairing potentially damaged neural tissue.</span>

          Many families have reported improvements in various autism symptoms following stem cell therapy, including:
        </p>
        
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Enhanced communication skills</li>
          <li>Improved social interaction</li>
          <li>Reduced repetitive behaviors</li>
          <li>Better emotional regulation</li>
          <li>Increased attention span and focus</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          It's important to note that responses vary between individuals, and stem cell therapy should be considered as part of a comprehensive treatment approach that may include behavioral therapies, educational interventions, and other supportive measures.
