          Autism, also known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects social interaction, communication, and behavior. 
          It presents differently in each person, resulting in unique challenges and strengths.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While there's no single known cause of autism, research suggests a combination of genetic and environmental factors may contribute to its development. 
          Early intervention and appropriate treatments can significantly improve outcomes for individuals with autism.

          Stem cell therapy represents an innovative approach to addressing autism's underlying neurological aspects, potentially offering improvements 
          in communication, social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and other symptoms. While research is ongoing, many families have reported meaningful 
          progress following stem cell treatment.
